**In situ surface marine observations**

This dataset provides access to surface marine meteorological weather reports and observations made by merchant and naval ships, drifting buoys and other platforms / vessels over the global oceans. The weather reports contain instantaneous, or point, observations of a number of key Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) and other parameters made at routine intervals (typically 1, 3, or 6 hourly). The parameters include, *inter alia*: sea surface temperature, air temperature and humidity, wind speed and direction, surface atmospheric pressure, weather conditions (present weather).


When complete, the data available will represent a reprocessing of the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS), Release 3.0 with major improvements made to the quality control and duplicate flagging of observations and improved availability of metadata. The current release represents a preliminary reprocessing, with additional data and flags planned to be added. A full description is given under the reports available from the documentation tab.
